# Counting Cards 
## Using Discrete Math to Beat the House

A game of blackjack that uses combinatorics and probability to create strategies to beat the house.

This repo contains three files.

The base_simulator.py files runs a simulator that mimics basic blackjack strategy without using any advanced strategies. We will use this as the control to determine the success of our advanced strategies.

The blackjack.py file is a regular game of blackjack. As of now this game does not include advice for the player. Once we have decided on the optimal strategy, we will use that strategy to advise the player.

The simulator.py file is where the different strategies will be played out over 2000 rounds of blackjack and will print basic metrics based on the outcomes of the rounds.
